## Research Implications
I learned that the countries with the most articles per capita are all western nations, with the fewest being Asian countries. The countries with the highest quality articles per capita are almost entirely in Southern Europe, while the countries with the lowest quality articles per capita aooears to be decently spread. Unsuprisingly then, European and wester n regions outperfom asian and even african regions in articles per capita and quality articles per capita.

I expected to see bias towards English speaking countries since we were looking at English Wikipedia, which is somewhat represented in the fact that European countries were the highest performing. There seems to be more of a divide between east and west rather than along language lines. These results suggest that English Wikipedia focuses on European and Western countries over Asian ones. To improve these issues, an interested party could modify the data with articles from other languages in Wikipedia.
